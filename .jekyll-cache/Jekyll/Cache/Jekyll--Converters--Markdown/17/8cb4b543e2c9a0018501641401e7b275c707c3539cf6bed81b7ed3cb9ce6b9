<p>I want to lay out some basic logic for counting things: Permutations, combinations, etc.</p>

<h1 id="alphabets-and-strings">Alphabets and Strings</h1>

<p>An alphabet is a set of letters <script type="math/tex">A = \{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_n\}</script>. The alphabet is has <script type="math/tex">n</script> elements like this: <script type="math/tex">\|A\| = n</script>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the basic concept of a <strong>string</strong>. We <strong>string</strong> together letters in a row, with no restrictions or limitations. If <script type="math/tex">A</script> is the English alphabet in standard a-b-c order, then <script type="math/tex">\alpha_{18} \alpha_{15} \alpha_{18} \alpha_{9} \alpha_{8}</script> spells the word “rorih”.</p>

<p>What if we have an alphabet with only two letters, and we want to write a 2-letter word? How many possibilities are there? Here’s a table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1st \ 2nd</th>
      <th><script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script></th>
      <th><script type="math/tex">\alpha_2</script></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">\alpha_1\alpha_1</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">\alpha_1\alpha_2</script></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">\alpha_2</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">\alpha_2\alpha_1</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">\alpha_2\alpha_2</script></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For your first choice, you have 2 letters to choose from. For your 2nd choice, you have 2 letters to choose from. So there are <script type="math/tex">2\times2=4</script> possibilities. If our alphabet had 3 letters you can imagine the <script type="math/tex">3\times3</script> version of the table.</p>

<p>How about if <script type="math/tex">l=3</script>? We can start with the table above, adding <script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script> to the end of each string. Then our table doubles. A 2nd layer comes out of the screen with all the same strings augmented by <script type="math/tex">\alpha_2</script>. The possibilities are <script type="math/tex">2\times2\times2 = 8</script>.</p>

<p>To add a fourth letter, we take our “cubed” table and repeat the doubling process to get <script type="math/tex">2\times2\times2\times2 = 16</script> possible strings.</p>

<p>The generalization goes like this: How many possible strings exist of length <script type="math/tex">l</script>, in an alphabet of size <script type="math/tex">n</script>? The answer is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overbrace{n\times n \times n \times \cdots \times n}^{l \text{ times}} = n^l.</script>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

    <p>Now you should be able to answer these questions fairly easily.</p>

    <p><script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> How many 3-letter initials are possible? (For example, I’m R.R.H.)</p>

    <p><script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> How high can a computer count with 8 bits? (IE, <script type="math/tex">A = \{0, 1\}</script>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="permutations">Permutations</h1>

<p><strong>Permutations</strong> are orderings of a set. Put another way, they are <strong>strings</strong> that use every letter <strong>exactly</strong> once. Imagine 3 people lining up in a row for a photograph. Here are some possible orderings:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">123 \quad 132 \quad 213 \quad 231 \quad 312 \quad 321</script>

<p>Did I miss any?</p>

<p>If we could clone people, like in <strong>strings</strong>, then there would be <script type="math/tex">3\times3\times3 = 27</script> possibilities!</p>

<p>But when I pick the first person and lock in my choice, I only have 2 people to draw on for the next option. After I pick the 2nd, then I’m done having options. There’s only one left. That’s why there are <script type="math/tex">3\times2\times1 = 6</script> options here.</p>

<p>What happens if I add a fourth person? Well, say I’m using the <script type="math/tex">123</script> ordering. Now there are four possible places for the new guy to stand:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">*1*2*3*</script>

<p>The same goes for each of the original 6 orderings. So now we have <script type="math/tex">4\times3\times2\times1 = 24</script> possibilities.</p>

<p>So how many permutations exist for an <script type="math/tex">n</script>-element set?</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot\cdots\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1 = n!</script>

<p><em>Permutations are important in group theory, and I’ll hopefully write about that soon and add a link here.</em></p>

<h2 id="questions-1">Questions</h2>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You're lining up 5 people to take a photograph. We already know there are $$5! = 120$$ ways to order them.

$$\cdot$$ What if the most dominant member insists on standing in the middle?

$$\cdot$$ What if there are 2 identical twins, and it doesn't matter if they switch places?
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="subsets">Subsets</h1>

<p>At this point we’re going to make a crucial change, and stop caring about <strong>order</strong>.</p>

<p>Imagine you have 10 precious toe-rings: Agate, Amethyst, Citrine, Diamond, Emerald, Onyx, Quartz, Ruby, Sapphire, and Turqoise. Every day when you leave home to your job as a surfing teacher, you select a <strong>subset</strong> of them to adorn your toes.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> If you’re feeling depressed and bring ZERO toe rings, you’ve brought a subset.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> If you have designs on a certain student and it’s a Ruby and Emerald day, you’ve brought a subset.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> If you bring a toe ring on EVERY TOE, you’ve brought a subset (namely, the whole set).</p>

<p>Get the picture? <strong>So, how many subsets are there of your 10 toe-rings?</strong></p>

<p>We can reduce this to a question about <strong>strings</strong> if we notice that each toe-ring is in one of two states: It’s either on your foot making everyone jealous, or it’s languishing at home in your special designated drawer. So, make an alphabet with 2 letters. I’ll use <script type="math/tex">0</script> and <script type="math/tex">1</script>. Then the 3 cases above correspond to:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> 0000000000
  <script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> 0000100100
  <script type="math/tex">\cdot</script> 1111111111</p>

<p>But wait! Our question has become:</p>

<p>How many strings of length 10 can I make with a 2-letter alphabet?</p>

<p>So in general, the number of subsets of $n$ items is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overbrace{2\times 2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2}^{n \text{ times}} = 2^n.</script>

<h1 id="combinations">Combinations</h1>

<p><strong>Combinations</strong> are strings that use every letter <strong>at most</strong> once.</p>
