title: What else is new?

I am not really doing much with this site! I need to remember how it works.
I'm over halfway done with my MS now. Last semester I took Ring Theory and Measure Theory and nearly lost interest in math completely.
For leisure reading now I've got *Inward Bound* by Abraham Pais.
