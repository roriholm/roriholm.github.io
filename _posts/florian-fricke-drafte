I knew with blogging that I would run into the same problem as with keeping a gournal. I rarely feel the need to put anything down! I guess I will try to lower my mental bar to keep a steady flo.

Anyways, I feel like writing about a band called **Popol Vuh**. They're named after the creation myth of a Mayan tribe from the Guatemalan highlands. The story was an oral tradition until it was written down in 1550 by a Dominican friar. I haven't read it, but like most cosmogonies I'm happy to write it off as bollocks.

Florian Fricke. Imagine a severe German boy, passionate about music and obsessed with pushing to new frontiers. Sort of a musical Ludwig Wittgenstein. Thanks to (also) being from a wealthy family, he ended up with a custom Moog Modular synthesizer system worth nearly 2 million of today's Earth Dollars. He started up Popol Vuh with the drummer Daniel Fichelscher, who is still living unlike Fricke who died in 2001.

My introduction to Popol Vuh was non-chronological, and for about 12 years I had only one treasured album / sleep aid that followed me from MP3 player to MP3 player. [Agape Agape (1983)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMpQa7V3xU) is a perfect collection of hypnotic little gems. As if Neuschwanstein castle was left incomplete because electric guitar was invented and everyone decided to jam all day instead of work.

I would have had the band pegged as repetitive melodies. (Hosianna Mantra (1972))[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwzTd3zE49E] is just as atmospheric but with a freer element.
