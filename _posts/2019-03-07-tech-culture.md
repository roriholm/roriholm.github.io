Quartz had an interesting article on digital identity. ([Your digital identity has three layers, and you can only protect one of them](https://qz.com/1525661/your-digital-identity-has-three-layers-and-you-can-only-protect-one-of-them/)). It's a well-intentioned model but kind of flawed - for example, I don't see a meaningful distinction between the inner 2 layers. Behavioral metadata IS behavioral data. Your words convey information, but so does your body language and facial expressions. For someone watching you talk, what good does it do to tease apart the two bundled sources of meaning? It's better to ask questions about their intentions and motivations, and the possible effects of their words.

This 'digital identity' thing is like Bohr's toy model for electron energy levels. I think we need Dirac's second quantization to relativize the theory and account for higher-order effects.

Digital identity isn't a unidirectional thing where you leave some behavioral footprint on the internet. Your thoughts and behaviors get effected by your info consumption, and your sources are as bottlenecked as your food supplies. Anyone using Reddit has seen extensive narrative-shaping by the moderators and admins. The biggest news aggregators are guildy of [blind and overexuberant sanitization](https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/31/sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta/) of content. The news and stories we get exposed to are highly tailored by a small group of people.

China's great dystopian success has been using technology to identify antisocial behavior, and telling [millions of bumpkins](https://www.sciencealert.com/china-has-a-credit-system-for-social-behavior-its-led-to-millions-of-travel-bans) that they're not allowed to leave home anymore. I'm all for keeping trashy people away from me, but I don't know if I would go that far.

Also in China, a Machine Learning model peeking at goverment official's bank accounts was TOO good at [busting corruption](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2184857/chinas-corruption-busting-ai-system-zero-trust-being-turned-being), so they had to turn it off.

So stay aware of your digital footprint... But only because of the ways that it could be packaged up and sent back to you.
