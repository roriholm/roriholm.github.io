* I ran across this recent article on a site called "Qualia Computing", which gives a model for our subjective experience of [time](https://qualiacomputing.com/2018/11/28/the-pseudo-time-arrow-explaining-phenomenal-time-with-implicit-causal-structures-in-networks-of-local-binding/). It's a little convoluted but also convincing. It reminds me of this more mathematically precise description of hallucinatory [vision](https://plus.maths.org/content/uncoiling-spiral-maths-and-hallucinations).
