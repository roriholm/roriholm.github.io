I knew with blogging that I would run into the same problem as with keeping a gournal. I rarely feel the need to put anything down! I guess I will try to lower my mental bar to keep a steady flo.

Anyways, I feel like writing about a band called **Popol Vuh**. They're named after the creation myth of a Mayan tribe from the Guatemalan highlands. The story was an oral tradition until it was written down in 1550 by a Dominican friar. I haven't read it, but like most cosmogonies I'm happy to write it off as bollocks.

Meet Florian Fricke. Imagine a severe German boy, passionate about music and obsessed with pushing to new frontiers. Sort of a musical Ludwig Wittgenstein. Thanks to (also) being from a wealthy family, he ended up with a custom Moog Modular synthesizer system worth nearly 2 million of today's Earth Dollars. He started up Popol Vuh with the drummer Daniel Fichelscher, who is still living unlike Fricke who died in 2001.

My introduction to Popol Vuh was non-chronological, and for about 12 years I had only one treasured album / sleep aid that followed me from MP3 player to MP3 player. [Agape Agape (1983)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMpQa7V3xU) is a perfect collection of hypnotic little gems. As if Neuschwanstein castle was left incomplete because electric guitar was invented and everyone decided to jam all day instead of work.

I would have had the band pegged as more of the same soothing, repetitive melodies. Until I started to listen to more. (Hosianna Mantra (1972))[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwzTd3zE49E] sounds like the Catholic Church started to incorporate LSD into their Sunday Mass. The psychedelic guitar licks are the phrasing equivalent of run-on sentences. What a great tune (and album).

On the 2-track (In Den Garten Pharos (1971))[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbQ1v-nCFjA] we first hear some absolutely SICK drumming from Mr. Daniel, then on track 2 (linked) Mr. Florian uses his $2 million Moog to fashion an impenetrable wall of sound; an unholy drone that would fit right into the Garden of Pharaoh, especially if he was a living dead mummy.

The mystical genius of Popol Vuh became well-known enough that they attracted the attention of the filmmaker Werner Herzog. He said "hey, this music can really transport you to another world. I need that for my movies!". [Aguirre (1975)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u7vzaqITMA) begins with the [mad conquistador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lope_de_Aguirre) and his party descending a cloudy mountain, with some really ethereal sounds setting the perfect tone.

(Spirit of Peace (1975))[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05A-LRoAzUc] shows off a mastery of acoustic, layered, choral sounds. You could sit in the middle of a large stone building as they play/sing, and feel the vibrations down to your bones. This is great background music for me when I am cleaning!

I hope I spread the gospel of Popol Vuh to someone! Enjoy!
