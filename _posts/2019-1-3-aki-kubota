The singer/keyboardist Aki Kubota has passed away. She was one of 4 personnel on KoenjiHyakkei's debut album, which made a HUGE impression on me and introduced me to the wonderful world of Zeuhl when I heard it back in 2005.

She also played on their 2nd album and in another jazz/fusion band called Bondage Fruit. Check out her sick vocals and keyboard lines in this song, which is like a little 6 minute apocalypse:
