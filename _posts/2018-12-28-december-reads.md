Welcome to my my new site! I decided to finally put my money where my mouth is and migrate out of Zuckerbag's twisted funhouse.

I'll just use this to drop links, commentary, music, or whatever I want. Make sure to check back every 10 minutes to get that sweet nectar that I'm sure to provide.

Without further adieu:

* A recent article on the site Qualia Computing gives a very avant-garde model for our subjective experience of [time](https://qualiacomputing.com/2018/11/28/the-pseudo-time-arrow-explaining-phenomenal-time-with-implicit-causal-structures-in-networks-of-local-binding/). It's a little verbose and convoluted, but also convincing when they get into weird events like time-loops and "moments of eternity" which apparently are things, though I have never had the horrific misfortune to experience them. The treatment reminds me of this more concise and mathematically precise description of hallucinatory [vision](https://plus.maths.org/content/uncoiling-spiral-maths-and-hallucinations).

* [Riemannium](https://thespectrumofriemannium.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/log050-why-riemannium/) is a mysterious vibrating substance. The Riemann Zeta function shows up all over number theory and physics. If you can prove that its zeros all lie on the same big + shape, you can win a [million dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems). One possible approach under the Hilbert-Polya conjecture is to notice that the zero distribution shares statistical characteristics with vibrating physical systems (along with random matrices, nuclei energy levels, etc). So the question is, what is this mysterious Riemannium whose vibrations cause the very structure of numbers? It is all HIGHLY funky and has been vexing mathematicians for 160 years now. This seems almost like over-exuberant speculation but there are also links between zeroes and [cosmic constants](http://www.thespectrumofriemannium.com/2018/11/10/log209-a-cosmic-link-with-a-non-trivial-zeta-zero/).
