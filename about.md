* Former Electronics Technician, USCG; math student, UMBC

* [WizardWars.io](http://wizardwars.io) is my Roguelike deathmatch IO game, which is severely fun and groundbreaking and underappreciated!

* I work at a startup called [Skayl](http://www.skayl.com). Our mission is to automate integration efforts that currently take massive amounts of money and man-hours.

* My interests include:

	* Functional programming languages like Scheme and [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)).

	* Asymptotic complexity and the [P vs. NP](https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf) question.

	* Algorithmic trading, with and without machine learning techniques.

	* Cryptocurrencies: applications, exploits, and theoretical innovations. I am watching the work going on with [verifiable delay functions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf)

	* Bikram yoga
